My solutions for http://adventofcode.com/

## Getting Started

All solutions in this repo are implemented using node.js version 5.1. Running the solution should be as simple as `cd`ing in the day's folder and running `node index.js`.

The puzzle's input is always stored in a variable called `input`, which is sometimes defined directly in the code, but mostly in an external file with the same name.

Have fun!
